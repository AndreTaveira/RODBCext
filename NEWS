--------------------
Changes in RODBCext 0.2 (2014-07-01)

- Added support for drivers which don't provide SQLDescribeParam()
  (through setting up some default data types and relying on the automatic ODBC types conversion)

- sqlExec() now merges results of all queries if nrows(data) > 1 and fetch=TRUE

- Ability to prepare and execute query in one call moved from sqlPrepare() to sqlExec():
  - sqlPrepare() now takes only odbcHandler and queryString arguments
  - sqlExec() given an additional queryString=NA argument

- Covering functions for those RODBC functions which can't cope with the state of RODBC connection handle after call to sqlPrepare().
  This functions call original RODBC ones after ensuring a right state of a connection handle.
