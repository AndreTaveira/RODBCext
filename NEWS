--------------------
Changes in RODBCext 0.2 (2014-07-01)

- Changes in API - ability to prepare and execute query in one call moved from 
  sqlPrepare() to sqlExec():
  - sqlPrepare() now takes only odbcHandler, queryString and errors arguments
  - sqlExec() now takes additional queryString=NA argument

- Added support for drivers which don't provide SQLDescribeParam() ODBC call
  (by using data types from data passed to sqlExecute())

- sqlExec() now merges results of all queries if nrows(data) > 1 and fetch=TRUE

- Added functions sqlFetchMore() and odbcFetchRows() which avoid calls to 
  RODBC::sqlFetchMore() and RODBC::odbcFetchRows() when connection handle is 
  in a "query prepared but not executed" state (which caused R crashes)

- Switch from RODBC::sqlFetchMore() to RODBC::sqlGetResults() for fetching 
  results (now we don't care about queries which do not produce any results
  like UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc. queries)
